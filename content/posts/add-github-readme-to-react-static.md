###### The problem

With so many places to update different career information (webpage about me, Github special README, LinkedIn about me) I thought
it might be nice to update my webpage about me based on the special README.

My webpage is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using [React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static).
